This project centers on Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting, a critical application within Machine Learning. The project underscores our strategy for predicting weather using a variety of neural networks and analyzing the Jena Climate dataset. Weâ€™ve constructed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models from scratch and also implemented Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) from the ground up and Multi-Layer LSTM models for comparative analysis. We utilized PySpark to manage the complexities of Big Data, especially with the extensive Jena Climate dataset.
